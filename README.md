# lily's mev reading list
This guide is for engineers who do not have a background in finance or economics but want to understand how to build better decentralized technology. 

'MEV', or maximal extractable value, from the view of a blockchain infrastructure or application developer, can be conceptualized as the way which entities are able to extract value from the underlying code structure. This list is heavy on market making strategy and algorithmic/model based trading topics as the behaviors in traditional finance are being copied in decentralized finance. Different from traditional finance, blockchains are not able to regulate entities via law into 'good' behavior and instead must rely on permission and incentive structures to enable the intended users to benefit from a system.

The resources in the list build on each other if consumed in order.

## MEV Reading List
1. [Flash Boys](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flash_Boys) by Michael Lewis
   - Good to read if you have zero intuition of why speed of information matters and want a spicy read. Is an odd read because the book better describes what is happening in blockchain trading. It is very wrong about how things work in tradfi (there is no front running in tradfi).
2. Complex Systems Season 1 Episode 1: [How the Smart Money teaches trading with Ricki Heicklen](https://www.complexsystemspodcast.com/episodes/teaching-trading-ricki-heicklen/)
   - Ricki Heicklen (ex Jane Street) discusses how she teaches people how to be algorithmic traders. Good to listen to understand how order book trading works from the perspective of the trader.
3. Acquired Season 14 Episode 3: [Renaissance Technologies](https://www.acquired.fm/episodes/renaissance-technologies)
   - Complete history of Renaissance Technologies. Goes over history of model-based trading and why being right 51% of the time will make you billions. Helpful to understand how to build bots introduced in Complex Systems episode and how stasticical games discussed in the the MEV-SBC'24 recording are centralizing. 
4. FlashBots MEV-SBC’24 Recording: Max Resnick & Phil Daian [The Incentives of Short Term Censorship Resistance](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SBOGdofF4u8).
   - Lays out how blockchain architecture affects how economic powerhouses are able to extract value. Main takeaway is that economic powerhouses (builders/searchers) will try to make money either through latency games, spamming games, or auctions. Blockchain architectures must choose which game they expose. 
5. [Flash Boys : Not So Fast: An Insider's Perspective on High-Frequency Trading](https://g.co/kgs/8LR9aQj) by Peter Kováč
   - Response book to Flash Boys, goes over why traditional fincance does not suffer from front running or other MEV games. Good to read to understand how unregulated blockchain trading is.
6. [Flash Boys 2.0: Frontrunning, Transaction Reordering, and Consensus Instability in Decentralized Exchanges](https://arxiv.org/abs/1904.05234) by Philip Daian Et al.
   - Lays out how MEV games are played on blockchains in an explicit manner.
